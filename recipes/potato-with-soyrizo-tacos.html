    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These smell of these potato with soyrizo tacos will make your mouth water,
            and the taste will have your taste buds dancing on your tongue. They are super fast to prepare and are 
            a great, fresh option for lunch or dinner. They are even good for breakfast!</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be nice if your tasty food looked even better? Well, this colorful dish fits the bill.
            The beautiful red of the tomato, emerald green of the cilantro, and bright white of the onion make these tacos
            almost too pretty to eat. The colors also invoke the red, green and white of the Mexican national flag, the 
            wonderful country that gave us the amazing taco. I can't think of too many food dishes that rank higher on my list,
            and I think many would agree with me. Let's see how we can get started on these tasty tacos.</p>

        <li>Tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>corn tortillas</li>
        <li>salsa (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put saut√© pan to medium-low heat and add olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cut the potato into medium sized pieces while pan and oil heat.</li>
        <li>When pan is ready, add potatoes and your spices.</li>
        <li>Chop your taco toppings while potatoes cook.</li>
        <li>When potatoes are just starting to crisp up, add soyrizo in the amount desired. Cook 
        just long enough for soyrizo to warm through.</li>
        <li>As the potato/soyrizo mix finishes, warm your tortillas on another pan.</li>
        <li>Assemble your tacos!</li>
    </ol>
