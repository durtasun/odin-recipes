The current project will see me creating a basic website, with multiple pages.
The main index page will display several food recipe names, and possibly images. This page will contain hypertext links for the different recipes.
The individual recipe pages will contain recipe descriptions, instructions, and images.
Through this project, I hope to improve upon HTML website construction with practice organizing text content, displaying images, and linking different HTML documents together through clickable links.
